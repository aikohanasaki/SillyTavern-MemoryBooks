export const DEFAULT_CONSOLIDATION_KEYWORD_PROMPT = `Based on this {{stmbtier}} summary, generate 15–30 standalone topical keywords that function as retrieval tags, not micro-summaries.
Keywords must be:
- Concrete and scene-specific (locations, objects, proper nouns, unique actions, repeated motifs).
- One concept per keyword — do NOT combine multiple ideas into one keyword.
- Useful for retrieval if the user later mentions that noun or action alone, not only in a specific context.
- Not {{char}}'s or {{user}}'s names.
- Not thematic, emotional, or abstract. Stop-list: intimacy, vulnerability, trust, dominance, submission, power dynamics, boundaries, jealousy, aftercare, longing, consent, emotional connection.

Avoid:
- Overly specific compound keywords (“David Tokyo marriage”).
- Narrative or plot-summary style keywords (“art dealer date fail”).
- Keywords that contain multiple facts or descriptors.
- Keywords that only make sense when the whole scene is remembered.

Prefer:
- Proper nouns (e.g., "Chinatown", "Ritz-Carlton bar").
- Specific physical objects ("CPAP machine", "chocolate chip cookies").
- Distinctive actions ("cookie baking", "piano apology").
- Unique phrases or identifiers from the scene used by characters ("pack for forever", "dick-measuring contest").

Your goal: keywords should fire when the noun/action is mentioned alone, not only when paired with a specific person or backstory.

Return ONLY a JSON array of 15-30 strings. No commentary, no explanations.`;
