- **Bugfix:** Remove math calculating context

## v4.7.0 (October 19, 2025)
- **Regex:** Added regex functions (uses existing regex extension)

## v4.6.12 (October 19, 2025)

- **Localized Prompts:** 
  - The English prompts have been localized to return memories in YOUR language.
  - Language locale is determined via your ST general language settings.
  - **New users:** No action required, STMB detects your language and does it automatically.
  - **Existing users:** to switch to localized built-in prompts, delete `SillyTavern/data/(yourusername)/user/files/stmb-summary-prompts.json` and then reopen the Summary Prompt Manager. It will re-create with localized built-in prompts. **Note:** Save a backup first if you made any changes!

## v4.6.9 (October 16, 2025)
- **Tweak:** change PromptManager to SummaryPromptManager to avoid confusion w ST base prompt manager

## v4.6.8 (October 16, 2025)

- **Bugfix:** Interval checkbox fixed

## v4.6.7 (October 16, 2025)
- **Housekeeping:** Doc rewrite, reorganizing files
  - reorganized resources into a `/resources` folder

## v4.6.4 (October 14, 2025)
- **Bugfix:** Chevron broke, fixed

## v4.6.3 (October 14, 2025)
- **Side Prompts Import is Now Additive:** Importing merges side prompts into your current set instead of replacing them. Existing prompts are preserved and only new prompts are added. If an imported prompt‚Äôs key conflicts with an existing one, the imported prompt is renamed using its display name (with a numeric suffix if needed).
- **Import UI Feedback Improved:** The import dialog now displays how many prompts were added and how many were renamed due to key conflicts.
- **Manual /sideprompt Name Lookup Greatly Improved:** The `/sideprompt` command now matches side prompts by key, display name, or slug (hyphen/underscore/space-insensitive, case-insensitive). For example, `/sideprompt cast-of-characters`, `/sideprompt cast`, and `/sideprompt "Cast of Characters"` will all run the same prompt if it exists.
- **Bugfix:** Resolves issues where built-in prompts could not be run by slug or key, or where imports previously overwrote existing side prompts.
- **Feature:** Side Prompts now support including previous memories for context (up to 7, matching main memory popup).
  - Added per-template "Previous memories for context" option to Side Prompt editor and new prompt dialog.
  - When set, up to 7 previous memories are fetched from the active lorebook and included in the side prompt input (in the same block format as main memory context).
  - Cap enforced in both UI and runtime.
  - Fully backward compatible; existing prompts default to 0.
