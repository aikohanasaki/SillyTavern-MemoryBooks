# üìï Memory Books (A SillyTavern Extension)

A next-generation SillyTavern extension for automatic, structured, and reliable memory creation. Mark scenes in chat, generate JSON-based summaries with AI, and store them as "[vectorized](#vectorized)" entries in your lorebooks. Supports group chats, advanced profile management, and bulletproof API/model handling.

## FAQ 
### Where is the entry in the Extensions menu?
Settings are located in the Extensions menu (the magic wand ü™Ñ to the left of your input box). Look for "Memory Books".

![Location of STMB settings](https://github.com/aikohanasaki/imagehost/blob/main/STMemoryBooks/menu.png)

### Vectorized?

The üîó entry in world info is named "vectorized" in ST's UI. This is why I use the world vectorized. If you don't use the vectors extension (I don't), it works via keywords. This is all automated so that you don't have to think about what keywords to use.

### 3. **Create a Memory**
- Open the Extensions menu (the magic wand ü™Ñ) and click "Memory Books", or use `/creatememory` slash command.
- Confirm settings (profile, context, API/model) if prompted.
- Wait for AI generation and automatic lorebook entry.

---

## üÜï Slash Command Shortcuts

- `/creatememory` will use existing chevron start/end markers to create a memory
- `/scenememory x-y` will make a memory starting with message x and ending with message y 
- `/nextmemory` will make a memory with all messages since the last memory. 

## üë• Group Chat Support

- All features work with group chats.
- Scene markers, memory creation, and lorebook integration are stored in group metadata.
- No special setup required‚Äîjust select a group chat and use as normal.

---

## üß≠ Modes of Operation

### **Automatic Mode (Default)**
- **How it works:** Automatically uses the lorebook that is bound to your current chat.
- **Best for:** Simplicity and speed. Most users should start here.
- **To use:** Ensure a lorebook is selected in the "Chat Lorebooks" dropdown for your character or group chat.

![Chat lorebook binding example](https://github.com/aikohanasaki/imagehost/blob/main/STMemoryBooks/chatlorebook.png)

### **Auto-Create Lorebook Mode** ‚≠ê *New in v4.2.0*
- **How it works:** Automatically creates and binds a new lorebook when none exists, using your custom naming template.
- **Best for:** New users and quick setup. Perfect for one-click lorebook creation.
- **To use:**
  1. Enable "Auto-create lorebook if none exists" in the extension's settings.
  2. Configure your naming template (default: "LTM - {{char}} - {{chat}}").
  3. When you create a memory without a bound lorebook, one is automatically created and bound.
- **Template placeholders:** {{char}} (character name), {{user}} (your name), {{chat}} (chat ID)
- **Smart numbering:** Automatically adds numbers (2, 3, 4...) if duplicate names exist.
- **Note:** Cannot be used simultaneously with Manual Lorebook Mode.

### **Manual Lorebook Mode**
- **How it works:** Allows you to select a different lorebook for memories on a per-chat basis, ignoring the main chat-bound lorebook.
- **Best for:** Advanced users who want to direct memories to a specific, separate lorebook.
- **To use:**
  1. Enable "Enable Manual Lorebook Mode" in the extension's settings.
  2. The first time you create a memory in a chat, you will be prompted to choose a lorebook.
  3. This choice is saved for that specific chat until you clear it or switch back to Automatic Mode.
- **Note:** Cannot be used simultaneously with Auto-Create Lorebook Mode.

## üìù Memory Generation

### **JSON-Only Output**
All prompts and presets **must** instruct the AI to return only valid JSON, e.g.:

```json
{
  "title": "Short scene title",
  "content": "Detailed summary of the scene...",
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
}
```
**No other text is allowed in the response.**

### **Built-in Presets**
1. **Summary:** Detailed beat-by-beat summaries.
2. **Summarize:** Markdown headers for timeline, beats, interactions, outcome.
3. **Synopsis:** Comprehensive, structured markdown.
4. **Sum Up:** Concise beat summary with timeline.
5. **Minimal:** 1-2 sentence summary.

### **Custom Prompts**

## üìö Lorebook Integration

- **Flag-Based Detection:** Only entries with the `stmemorybooks` flag are recognized as memories.
- **Auto-Numbering:** Sequential, zero-padded numbering with multiple supported formats (`[000]`, `(000)`, `{000}`, `#000`).
- **Manual/Automatic Order:** Per-profile insertion order settings.
- **Editor Refresh:** Optionally auto-refreshes the lorebook editor after adding a memory.

> **Existing memories must be converted!**
> Use the [Lorebook Converter](/resources/lorebookconverter.html) to add the `stmemorybooks` flag and required fields.

- **Auto-numbering:** Use `[0]`, `[00]`, `(0)`, `{0}`, `#0`, and now also the wrapped forms like `#[000]`, `([000])`, `{[000]}` for sequential, zero-padded numbering.
- **Custom Formats:** You can create your own formats. As of v4.5.1, all printable Unicode characters (including emoji, CJK, accented, symbols, etc.) are allowed in titles; only Unicode control characters are blocked.
