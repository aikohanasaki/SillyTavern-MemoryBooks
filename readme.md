### üìö Power Up with Lorebook Ordering (STLO)

For advanced memory organization and deeper story integration, we highly recommend using STMB together with [SillyTavern-LorebookOrdering (STLO)](https://github.com/aikohanasaki/SillyTavern-LorebookOrdering/blob/main/guides/STMB%20and%20STLO%20-%20English.md). See the guide for best practices, setup instructions, and tips!

> Note: Supports various languages: see [`/locales`](locales) folder for list. Internaional/localized Readme and User Guides can be found in the [`/userguides`](userguides) folder. 
> Lorebook converter and side prompt template library are in the [`/resources`](resources) folder.

## FAQ 
### Where is the entry in the Extensions menu?
Settings are located in the Extensions menu (the magic wand ü™Ñ to the left of your input box). Look for "Memory Books".

![Location of STMB settings](https://github.com/aikohanasaki/imagehost/blob/main/STMemoryBooks/menu.png)

### Vectorized?

The üîó entry in world info is named "vectorized" in ST's UI. This is why I use the world vectorized. If you don't use the vectors extension (I don't), it works via keywords. This is all automated so that you don't have to think about what keywords to use.

## üö¶ What's New (v4.6.10)

### üåê Localization/Internationalization
- **Localized Prompts:** 
  - The English prompts have been localized to return memories in YOUR language.
  - Language locale is determined via your ST general language settings.
  - **New users:** No action required, STMB detects your language and does it automatically.
  - **Existing users:** to switch to localized built-in prompts, delete `SillyTavern/data/(yourusername)/user/files/stmb-summary-prompts.json` and then reopen the Summary Prompt Manager. It will re-create with localized built-in prompts. **Note:** Save a backup first if you made any changes!

---

## üìã Prerequisites

- **SillyTavern:** 1.13.5+ (latest recommended)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è**INSTALL FOR ALL USERS:**‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Because STMB re-uses so many functions from ST base code, please ensure that the extension is installed for all users so that the location is `/public/scripts/extensions/third-party/SillyTavern-MemoryBooks`. Otherwise, function imports fail.
- **Scene Selection:** Start and end markers (start < end) must be set.
- **Chat Completion Support:** Full support for OpenAI, Claude, Anthropic, OpenRouter, or other chat completion API.
- **Text Completion Support:** Text completion APIs (Kobold, TextGen, etc.) are supported when connected via full manual configuration or custom completion source in SillyTavern.

### KoboldCpp Tips to using üìï ST Memory Books
Set this up in ST (you can change back to Text Completion AFTER you get STMB working)
- Chat Completion API
- Custom chat completion source
- `http://localhost:5001/v1` endpoint (you can also use `127.0.0.1:5000/v1`)
- enter anything in "custom API key" (doesn't matter, but ST requires one)
- model ID must be `koboldcpp/modelname` (don't put .gguf in the model name!)
- download a chat completion preset and import it (any one will do) just so you HAVE a chat completion preset. It avoids errors from "not supported"

## üí° Recommended Global World Info/Lorebook Activation Settings

- **Match Whole Words:** leave unchecked (false)
- **Scan Depth:** higher is better (at least 4)
- **Max Recursion Steps:** 2 (general recommendation, not required)
- **Context %:** 40% (based on a context window of 100,000 tokens) - assumes you don't have super-heavy chat history or bots

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Install & Load**
- Load SillyTavern and select a character or group chat.
- Wait for the chevron buttons (‚ñ∫ ‚óÑ) to appear on chat messages (may take up to 10 seconds).

![Wait for these buttons](https://github.com/aikohanasaki/imagehost/blob/main/STMemoryBooks/startup.png)

### 2. **Mark a Scene**
- Click ‚ñ∫ on the first message of your scene.
- Click ‚óÑ on the last message.

![Visual feedback showing scene selection](https://github.com/aikohanasaki/imagehost/blob/main/STMemoryBooks/button-start.png)

### 3. **Create a Memory**
- Open the Extensions menu (the magic wand ü™Ñ) and click "Memory Books", or use `/creatememory` slash command.
- Confirm settings (profile, context, API/model) if prompted.
- Wait for AI generation and automatic lorebook entry.

---

## üÜï Slash Command Shortcuts

- `/creatememory` will use existing chevron start/end markers to create a memory
- `/scenememory x-y` will make a memory starting with message x and ending with message y 
- `/nextmemory` will make a memory with all messages since the last memory. 

## üë• Group Chat Support

- All features work with group chats.
- Scene markers, memory creation, and lorebook integration are stored in group metadata.
- No special setup required‚Äîjust select a group chat and use as normal.

---

## üß≠ Modes of Operation

### **Automatic Mode (Default)**
- **How it works:** Automatically uses the lorebook that is bound to your current chat.
- **Best for:** Simplicity and speed. Most users should start here.
- **To use:** Ensure a lorebook is selected in the "Chat Lorebooks" dropdown for your character or group chat.

![Chat lorebook binding example](https://github.com/aikohanasaki/imagehost/blob/main/STMemoryBooks/chatlorebook.png)

### **Auto-Create Lorebook Mode** ‚≠ê *New in v4.2.0*
- **How it works:** Automatically creates and binds a new lorebook when none exists, using your custom naming template.
- **Best for:** New users and quick setup. Perfect for one-click lorebook creation.
- **To use:**
  1. Enable "Auto-create lorebook if none exists" in the extension's settings.
  2. Configure your naming template (default: "LTM - {{char}} - {{chat}}").
  3. When you create a memory without a bound lorebook, one is automatically created and bound.
- **Template placeholders:** {{char}} (character name), {{user}} (your name), {{chat}} (chat ID)
- **Smart numbering:** Automatically adds numbers (2, 3, 4...) if duplicate names exist.
- **Note:** Cannot be used simultaneously with Manual Lorebook Mode.

### **Manual Lorebook Mode**
- **How it works:** Allows you to select a different lorebook for memories on a per-chat basis, ignoring the main chat-bound lorebook.
- **Best for:** Advanced users who want to direct memories to a specific, separate lorebook.
- **To use:**
  1. Enable "Enable Manual Lorebook Mode" in the extension's settings.
  2. The first time you create a memory in a chat, you will be prompted to choose a lorebook.
  3. This choice is saved for that specific chat until you clear it or switch back to Automatic Mode.
- **Note:** Cannot be used simultaneously with Auto-Create Lorebook Mode.

## üìù Memory Generation

### **JSON-Only Output**
All prompts and presets **must** instruct the AI to return only valid JSON, e.g.:

```json
{
  "title": "Short scene title",
  "content": "Detailed summary of the scene...",
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
}
```
**No other text is allowed in the response.**

### **Built-in Presets**
1. **Summary:** Detailed beat-by-beat summaries.
2. **Summarize:** Markdown headers for timeline, beats, interactions, outcome.
3. **Synopsis:** Comprehensive, structured markdown.
4. **Sum Up:** Concise beat summary with timeline.
5. **Minimal:** 1-2 sentence summary.

### **Custom Prompts**
- Create your own, but **must** return valid JSON as above.

---

## üìö Lorebook Integration

- **Automatic Entry Creation:** New memories are stored as entries with all metadata.
- **Flag-Based Detection:** Only entries with the `stmemorybooks` flag are recognized as memories.
- **Auto-Numbering:** Sequential, zero-padded numbering with multiple supported formats (`[000]`, `(000)`, `{000}`, `#000`).
- **Manual/Automatic Order:** Per-profile insertion order settings.
- **Editor Refresh:** Optionally auto-refreshes the lorebook editor after adding a memory.

> **Existing memories must be converted!**
> Use the [Lorebook Converter](/resources/lorebookconverter.html) to add the `stmemorybooks` flag and required fields.

---

### üé° Side Prompts

Side Prompts can be used like trackers and will create entries in your memory lorebook. 
- **Access:** From the Memory Books settings, click ‚Äúüé° Side Prompt Manager‚Äù.
- **Features:**
    - View all side prompts.
    - Create new or duplicate prompts to experiment with different prompt styles.
    - Edit or delete any preset (including built-ins).
    - Export and import presets as JSON files for backup or sharing.
    - Run them manually or automatically with memory creation.
- **Usage Tips:**
    - When creating a new prompt, you can copy from built-ins for best compatibility.
    - Additional Side Prompts Template Library [JSON file](resources/SidePromptTemplateLibrary.json) - just import to use

### üß† Regex Integration for Advanced Customization
- **Full Control Over Text Processing**: Memory Books now integrates with SillyTavern's **Regex** extension, allowing you to apply powerful text transformations at two key stages:
    1.  **Prompt Generation**: Automatically modify the prompts sent to the AI by creating regex scripts that target the **User Input** placement.
    2.  **Response Parsing**: Clean, reformat, or standardize the AI's raw response before it's saved by targeting the **AI Output** placement.
- **Multi-Select Support**: You can now multi-select regex scripts. All enabled scripts will be applied in sequence at each stage (Prompt Generation and Response Parsing), allowing for advanced and flexible transformations.
- **How It Works**: The integration is seamless. Simply create and enable (multi-select) your desired scripts in the Regex extension, and Memory Books will apply them automatically during memory and side prompt creation.

---

## üë§ Profile Management

- **Profiles:** Each profile includes API, model, temperature, prompt/preset, title format, and lorebook settings.
- **Import/Export:** Share profiles as JSON.
- **Profile Creation:** Use the advanced options popup to save new profiles.
- **Per-Profile Overrides:** Temporarily switch API/model/temp for memory creation, then restore your original settings.

- **No scene selected:**
  - Mark both start (‚ñ∫) and end (‚óÑ) points.

- **Scene overlaps with existing memory:**
  - Choose a different range, or enable "Allow scene overlap" in settings.

![Scene overlap warning](https://github.com/aikohanasaki/imagehost/blob/main/STMemoryBooks/overlap.png)

- **AI failed to generate valid memory:**
  - Use a model that supports JSON output.
  - Check your prompt and model settings.

- **Token warning threshold exceeded:**
  - Use a smaller scene, or increase the threshold.

- **Missing chevron buttons:**
  - Wait for extension to load, or refresh.

- **Character data not available:**
  - Wait for chat/group to fully load.
